- See HowTo. The biggest issue is a) how are objects created? Who creates them?
- Hardest thing to deal with is state management. This needs fixing. Particularly:
-- How do you change state?
-- How do you know when state has changed?
-- Take a look, for example, at moving an object. It's messed up
- everything is broke. Unit test the navigator.
- Create tests that show the game class has no unity depencies.
- Fix infinite loop bug and have a dead state. The GOs are destroyed, but not the domain objects.
- The lists of Unity objects and Game Entites needs cleaning up. 
- Game should be creating all the objects, not the renderers. 
- What is called once per frame?


9/12 

- Fixed the navigation bug.
- enemy attacks. hard coded.

3/17

- Renderers are a little more abstract

3/16

- Created the event when a unit takes damage. Now make sure it can affect the
unity object. However, the bases are drawn statically, not at runtime, so need to hook their
objects. Going to have to write map stuff anyway so may as well do this quick and dirty now. 
- Can destroy bases

3/2 

- Lots moved out of the controller.
- Worked on attacking the other unit. Need to save which unit is being
attacked.
- Create a domain Game oject and move all the game logic to it without any 
unity runtime dependencies on monobehaviours.
