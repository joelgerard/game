How-to:
- Add a game object?
- Change state?


Program flow so far

- GameController.cs is what Unity calls when the frame updates.
- It passes off control to the GameService. The GameService coordinates
parsing the input and decided what goes where. It sends events to Game.cs,
which controls all of the game logic, and sends back render events for the 
game service to deal with. 
-- Game doesn't have ANY unity runtime stuff. You can test it with vanilla
unit test stuff.
-- GameService does. It's harder to unit test. It integrates the Domain and Unity runtime.


Events (WIP)
- Currently, there are two kinds of events. 
-- The first is when input is created. These events are sent to the game, which return objects
to render. 
-- The second, like when a soldier loses a battle, is using c# delegates.

This requires some thinking and cleaning up.
