How-to:
- Add a game object?
- Change state?


Add a game object?
- Right now, when you click, the GameService creates the objects, which makes sense
- However, it means you need to do everything in Unity space, not GameSpace (both area and logic).
- I think the better thing to do is to have the Game create whatever it wants, and let the GameService (renderer)
    deal with it. 

// TODO: Need to decide on how this goes. 
    // Maybe it should be: Input => Game => Renderer
    // right now it's Input => Renderer => Game
    // Or maybe, the AI should drive the clicks in the same way a PLayer does?
    // Seems awkward.
